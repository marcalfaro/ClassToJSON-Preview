This lightweight extension makes it effortless to convert your class symbols into JSON strings directly within Visual Studio. Itâ€™s especially useful when testing API endpoints, allowing you to quickly generate JSON payloads on the fly without leaving your IDE.

You can serialize your class models in two convenient ways:

A. By selecting and right-clicking your class in Solution Explorer and convert it instantly.

In your code editor, you can choose to output the generated JSON string to your Clipboard, Notepad, or the IDE's document editor. You can even place the caret either on your type declaration or the variable name.

Save time and streamline your API testing by generating JSON payloads with just a click!
